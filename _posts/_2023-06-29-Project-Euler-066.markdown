A diophantine equation is one where the only solutions of interest are integer solutions. That makes them quite tricky to solve, and they require a different approach. I tried to brute force it a couple of times but it quickly became appearent that it wouldn't work. There was obviously a trick to it. I googled around but couldn't find anything relevant, so I left it. This was ~5 years ago. 

Now, this problem was the lowest numbered one that I hadn't solved, so I decided to give it another shot. I rather quickly found out about [Pell's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell%27s_equation){:target="_blank"}.

Full code is on [Github](https://github.com/MyosQ/euler-solutions){:target="_blank"}.
