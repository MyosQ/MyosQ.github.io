It took me quite some time to read this book and it will take quite some time to summarize my thoughts about it. But this is the kind of book that is best read slowly and by pausing and pondering as you read. And the main reason I have started writing reviews/summaries is to force myself to reflect better on what I read. Summarizing a concept is much more demanding than solely grasping it.
